# SE-Team4-Project
Team 4 Group Code space for development of Software Engineering Project.

Our application uses two python packages. These packages are 'tkinter' and 'psycopg2.'
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECKING AND INSTALLING TKINTER:
1) Check if the tkinter package is installed by running the following command in terminal: python -m tkinter
2) If a dialoge box containing two buttons appears, then tkinter is already installed.
3) If there is no dialoge box then run the following command: pip install tk
4) Once again, check if it is properly installed using: python -m tkinter
------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING PSYCOPG2:

1) To install psycopg2, run the following command: pip install psycopg2.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Both the pre-requiste packages for the application are now installed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the application:

1) Currently, you must install the packages specified and then download the zip file
2) Next, you can run the main.py from wherever it was saved


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:

1) As of now, the command that removes the border for the splash_screen only works on windows, this command makes it invisible on mac
