# SE-Team4-Project
Team 4 Group Code space for development of Software Engineering Project.

Our application uses two python packages. These packages are 'tkinter' and 'psycopg2.'
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECKING AND INSTALLING TKINTER:
1) Check if the tkinter package is installed by running the following command in terminal: python -m tkinter
2) If a dialoge box containing two buttons appears, then tkinter is already installed.
3) If there is no dialoge box then run the following command: pip install tk
4) Once again, check if it is properly installed using: python -m tkinter
------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING PSYCOPG2:

1) To install psycopg2, run the following command: pip install psycopg2.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Both the pre-requiste packages for the application are now installed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the application:

1) Currently, you must install the packages specified and then download the GitHub zip file
2) Next, you can run the main.py from wherever it was saved
3) Then, after entering all players and after countdown, answer prompts in command line (to run given udp code). Note that the countdown for the 6 minute game will start and everything will start working immediately after prompts are answered.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:

1) For mac, the program must show a border with the image (but will now show and windows works as expected)
2) Use the terminal rather than an IDE for the installation commands.
3) Currently, this is setup to show examples using the udp function, this requires player_ids 1 and 2 to be on the left and player_ids 3 and 4 to be on the right, will work properly with up to 15 players per team if these are included.
4) To see this without the udp, comment out lines 229 and 230
